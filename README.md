This is one of my project for monitoring mail in and mail out for a local government judiciary (kejaksaan). It used AngularJS for the front end and Slim PHP Framework for the backend (REST, database connection, etc). I used Restangular component as a bridge to connect them. To show up the data in a table format and do some CRUD job, I use UI-Grid (angular-ui-grid) component. The others important components I used are angular-ui-router, angular-bootstrap, angular-animate, angular-flash and ng-file-upload.
